                    cigars. We are located In Scotland, UK. We mainly meet up in Glasgow city centre once a month. Even through

                    <h2 class="head-color">OUR MISSION</h2>
                    <p>We were founded back in 2016 with just a few of us meeting up now and again for a good cigar.
                    Our main topic of conversation was usually about why we didn't have more people to enjoy cigars with and, 
                    due to the smoking laws, not enough places to smoke a cigar. From that moment on we created what we know now
                    as 'Cigar Caballeros'. Our mission from the creation of our club was to educate potential brothers and sisters 
                    of the leaf on all cigar knowledge. Find out all reputable locations for our smoking grounds. Buy from all 
                    known retailers, both online and brick and mortar shops. Review them for our club members to get the best
                    discount we can find for our members. As well as helping our members to do some jargon busting. We know how 
                    daunting it can be to be in a cigar shop or lounge and others around you are talking shop but you feel inadequate.
                    Well,no more my dear 'Caballeros' we aim to fix this problem for you and make you feel right at home in any lounge
                    you will visit. Lastly, and most importantly we a forum in which everyone can come to feel comfortable and safe
                    to smoke cigars with us. Not to forget that membership is completely FREE!!! </p>
