# CIGAR CABALLEROS
My task for this project is to build a static site using HTML5, CSS3 and the Bootstrap framwork. It is to have a
minimum of three pages. I took this opportunity to develop the skills I have learned so far to further my passion
for cigars. I currently have a cigar club website which I wanted to redesign. The idea of this redesign is to keep
it simplistic and easy to use.

## UX
* As a user, I want to be able to find local meet ups, so that I can enjoy my cigars with.

* As a user, I want to better understand cigar terms, without the need to research more.

* As a user, I want to have a space to communicate with cigar specialists to understand how to care for my own 
cigars.

* As a user, I want to see more instructional videos to learn how to deal with my own cigars.

* As a user, I want more ways to interact with other cigar smokers so that I donâ€™t always need to make it to a 
cigar event.

* As a user, I want to see cigar caballeros social media links so I can find more information on cigars and events.

## FEATURES
The layout of the pages to this site is the same. This is to keep continuity and allow users to broswe the site 
more easily with less chance of getting lost. It has six pages to the website which is all clearly marked for ease 
of navigation. I have tried to keep a very simplistic approach to the design with the user in mind.

### Existing Features

##### Header
A simple club logo. This is to help a user recognise where they are and who we are as a club.

#### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is a simply and elegant design. It is to the point and helps users get to their desired pages 
easily.

#### Footer
Here we have four of our social links for users to engage and interact with us in different ways. Very impactful as
the icons are big enough to see and the colours are inlione with the logo.

#### Images
All the images are from the club and unique. This will allow users to get a better in depth view of what the club 
offers.

#### Contact Us from
A simple form for new users to contact the club. Easy for anyone to engage the club with all cigar related questions.

#### Sign Up form
The sign up form is also a simple form for all users looking to join. It also emphasises there is no joining fee 
at all.

#### Jumbotron (index.html)
The jumbrotron used here is to attract users immediately who land on the page and are looking for immdiate sign up.
Just click on the 'Join Free' button and it will take you straigh to the sign up form.

#### Jumbotron (whatsapp.html)
A seperate page was added to the 'What's App' icon on the footer. When the icon is clicked the iuser is taken to 
the whatsapp page. This is yet another way for new users to connect with the club. A mobile number is already 
available for a new user to take and use. Once connected the user will be automatically added to he group. 

#### YouTube videos
Currently the club has no unique content for videos. I have implemented some other cigar afficionados with cigar 
instructional videos onto the site. They are slightly longer than a brief clip but very informative and educational 
to amateur or intermediate cogar smokers.

#### Social icons
As social media continues to grow in popularity I have implemented the clubs social links into the site. For users
who are actively looking for Facebook, Instagram or the likes we have that to hand for them too.

### Features Left To Implement
In the future the club would be looking to take online cogar meets to the next level with more virtual herfing.
Possibly an application that allows users to pay and join in to a cigar event.

The club is looking to do merchandise and will in time implement and online store.
