# CIGAR CABALLEROS

![alt text][logo]

My project is a 6 page website. Consisting of a home, cigars, the process, cigar time, contact us and a whatsapp 
page. The aim of my website is to draw new and old cigar lovers to meet up and share cigars. As well as a few 
pages with information on cigars for new cigar enthusiasts. The main draw for the website is to have users join 
the group for free and connect with the club through other sources of social media.

## UX

The client wanted a user experience that was simple and easy to navigate. As well as, a site for users to come and
meet fellow cigar lovers and to have good information for new cigar enthusiasts to look into and get started.

Below is the user stories:

* As a user, I want to be able to find local meet ups, so that I can enjoy my cigars with.

* As a user, I want to have a space to communicate with cigar specialists to understand how to care for my own 
cigars.

* As a user, I want to see more instructional videos to learn how to deal with my own cigars.

* As a user, I want more ways to interact with other cigar smokers so that I donâ€™t always need to make it to a 
cigar event.

* As a user, I want to see cigar caballeros social media links so I can find more information on cigars and events.

## FEATURES

### Existing Features

The features of this website are listed below.

* Header holds the logo image. (Client doesn't have a better logo file at the moment.)

* Navigation bar with toggler when screen size is reduced.

* Images throughout the site. All images are owned by the client.

* A google map of the location of a previous cigar event.

* Forms in cigartime.html and contactus.html.

* Footer contains all the clients social media links. As social media continues to grow in popularity I have 
implemented the clubs social links into the site. For users who are actively looking for Facebook, Instagram or 
the likes we have that to hand for them too.

* Jumbotron (index.html) - The jumbrotron used here is to attract users immediately who land on the page and are 
looking for immdiate sign up. Just click on the 'Join Free' button and it will take you straigh to the sign up form.

* Jumbotron (whatsapp.html) - A seperate page was added to the 'What's App' icon on the footer. When the icon is 
clicked the iuser is taken to the whatsapp page. This is yet another way for new users to connect with the club. A 
mobile number is already available for a new user to take and use. Once connected the user will be automatically 
added to he group. 

* YouTube videos are embedded because currently the club has no unique content for videos. I have implemented some 
other cigar afficionados with cigar instructional videos onto the site. They are slightly longer than a brief clip 
but very informative and educational to amateur or intermediate cogar smokers.

### Features Left To Implement
In the future the club would be looking to take online cigar meets to the next level with more virtual herfing.
Possibly an application that allows users to pay and join in to a cigar event. However this is out of my scope 
at the moment.

The club is looking to do merchandise and will in time implement and online store. This cannot be implemented until
the client has merchandise to sell.
