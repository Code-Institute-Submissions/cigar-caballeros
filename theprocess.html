                <h1 class="head-color center">THE PROCESS</h1>
                <p>We assume most cigar lovers have something we call 'the process' for enjoying cigars. The 'Caballero' way is
                just another method. Let me delve in a little deeper. The 'process' is basically the way we like to choose a cigar,
                cut, light and taste a cigar. It is a full process and somethig I personally do every time I light up a stick.
                With the help of some fellow brothers and sisters of the leaf I will explain our cigar process along with some video.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="head-color center">THE CHOICE</h2>
                <p>It all starts with the cigar you choose. This can be something from your own collection or from a cigar shop. Either
                way, this part is important. As we already mentioned before there are Cubans and New Worlds. Then there is a light, medium
                or a full bodied smoke. Not to forget what time of day it might be and whether you have had a meal or not too. Once you 
                know these small details you can then go on to choose the cigar of your choice. Remember this is only one methed. The 
                'Caballeros' method. You can do it any which way. John from 'Famous Smoke Shop' will tell you what to do as a beginner.

                <h2 class="head-color center">THE CUT</h2>
                <p>Now that you have the cigar picked out the thing is to cut your cigar. If you buy machine rolled cigars this is a step
                you can skip. Most machine rolled cigars are not closed at the head. However, for the rest of us with a hand rolled cigar
                this step is essential. Starting with what we use to cut the cigar. There are many methods, some savage and most very eloquent.
                Using your teeth to chew off the cap is not recommeneded, especially if you have spent a small fortune purchasing your cigar.
                I have seen first hand some cigar lovers using their nails to cut a hole on the cap of the cigar. It is somewhat uncouth but
                I suppose it gets the job done. But moving back to a civilised world of cutting we can start with a cigar punch. This tool will
                'punch' a small hole in the cap of your cigar. Leaving you a clean single hole to draw from. The next is the v-cut. As the name
                suggests this will cut a 'V' into the head of your cigar. Again it leaves a clean cut and allows nice smooth air flow when smoking.
                The final and a favourite of mine is the straigh cut. This is achieved with a single or a double guillotine cutter. The video below 
                will be from the lovely Delica better known as 'Cigar Vixen' who will discuss all the cutting methods.
                </p>

                <h2 class="head-color center">THE LIGHT & TASTE</h2>
                <p>Once you have cut your cigar the next thing is to light the bad boy up. Again there are a few methods of lighting. But there is only
                rule you should always remember. Technically it is two. The first is never EVER use a petrol lighter to light your cigar. The second is
                if you are using a match make sure that all the chemicals are burnt away before the flame touches the cigar. You are probably asking why
                at this point. The answer to both points is the taste. Petrol and the match tip chemicals will introduce a taste into your cigar that will
                be unwanted. Most likely will ruin your enjoyment of the lovely creation. The main tool we use here is a jet flame lighter. However soft
                flames can be used again just make sure it is butane and not petrol. You can also purchase cigar matches to light your cigar. They are 
                basically very long match sticks. Also again to remember to burn the match tip away before the light. The last method and most traditional
                way to light your cigar is from a cedar spill. I do like to light my cigars this way from time to time but it requires patience. There 
                </p>
                <p>Before we rush off to the video I would like to also touch briefly on the taste of a cigar. This can be a general or a very individual thing.
                What I mean is we could smoke the same cigar but get moderately different tastes. The main flavours will always be there but it is the nuances that
                will seperate small flavours for us. This can be affected by what we have eaten or if we have allergies at the time of smoking and so on. This 
                particular topic could be discussed at great lengths so I think just to leave you in the capable hands of the 'Cigar Vixen' again will be better.
                But perheaps when you come along to a cigar meet we can discuss it more.

                <p>There you have it. The 'Cigar Caballeros' method to the 'Process'. Now that you have your cigar lit and smoking all that is left now is to enjoy it.
                No doubt we could be here for quite some time talking about all aspects of how to smoke a cigar. But for now we feel this is enough for you to get 
                started. Learning the art of cigars is great but there is no better way to learn than to smoke and of course enjoy. Stay smokey!
