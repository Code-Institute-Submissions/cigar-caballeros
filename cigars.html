                    <p>Are you new to cigars? Maybe you have been a cigar lover for a while? Possibly even been at the long 
                    standing argument of Cubans vs New World cigars. We are no different here at Cigar Caballeros. On most 
                    cigar meets this topic pops ups and somethimes even hysteriacl debates happen. So rather than making a point
                    of what the world thinks is better, we will just you our opinion.</p>

                    <h2 class="head-color center">Cuban Cigars</h2>
                    <p>Cohiba, Montecristo and many more are names I am sure even some none cigar smokers have heard of. Cuba and 
                    cigars are pretty much synonymus the world over. From an observational stand point many would say they produce
                    the best cigars in the world. But then agan how do we rate somethig as best in the world? All cuban cigars are
                    classed as 'puros' basically meaning all leaves have been harvested from Cuba. Again, is that what makes it the best?
                    If you are a Cuban lover then you will most likely say they are the best simply because of your love for a finely made
                    Cuban cigar. However, flavour profiles on a Cuban has little to no complexity. This does not mean they aren't a great
                    cigar. The simplest way to explain this is that a Cuban cigar will have one to just a few flavours that will remain the
                    same throughout the cigar.</p>

                    <h2 class="head-color center">New World Cigars</h2>
                    <p>Since the US embargo happened it led a new style of cigar to emerge. Many who fled Cuba ended up in countries like
                    Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Honduras and many other South American countries. The Cuban tobacco farmers took their 
                    tobacco seeds and decided to start growing tobacco in different regions of where they settled. This in turn started up 
                    brands like La Flor Dominicana, Joya De Nicaragua and many more. The American cigar market welcomed these companies with
                    open arms. Nowadays many would argue that new world cigars are better than Cubans. Again the question is what makes it 
                    better? Is it from the fact that many new world cigars have a wonderful complexity of flavours? Or simply the price point.
                    It is common knowledge that Cuban cigars cost a lot more than a New World cigar. This is more true in the UK market as to 
                    the US market. Not all New Worlds have massive complex flavours. But I can tell you that the flavours are dramatically 
                    different to a Cuban.</p>

                    <h2 class="head-color center">Our Verdict</h2>
                    <p>This is not only an age old discussion but a common one in the club. Our take on this as a group decision is that no open
                    cigar is better than the other. I am a Cuban fan first and formost but can say I have easily smoked more New World cigars. Another 
                    member loves New Worlds and smokes them by the box load but will always like to enjoy a smooth Cuban Montecristo from time to time.
                    So our final thoughts on this matter is smoke what you like. Sometimes it is simply a state of mind. You wake up and you want a Cuban
                    cigar. Other times you're in great company and feel that a big ring gauge New World is right up your alley. Our rule in the club is
                    to try all cigars before you make your mind up. There is now right or wrong way.
